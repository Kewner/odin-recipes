    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This rump roast recipe is the oven version of the original I got from my
      mother. It is unbelievably delicious.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
      <li>1 (4 pound) beef pot roast</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon brown sugar</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon dry mustard</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon black pepper</li>
      <li>3 large potatoes, quartered</li>
      <li>3 carrots, peeled and cut into 2-inch pieces</li>
      <li>1 onion, sliced</li>
      <li>⅓ cup vinegar</li>
      <li>⅓ cup water</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        Heat vegetable oil in a Dutch oven over medium heat. Cook roast in hot
        oil until browned on all sides, 2 to 3 minutes per side.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix together brown sugar, salt, mustard, and black pepper in a small
        bowl; sprinkle evenly over roast. Arrange potatoes, carrots, and onion
        in the Dutch oven around roast. Pour vinegar and water over vegetables.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cover and cook in the preheated oven until roast is hot in the center
        and just turning from pink to grey, about 4 hours. An instant-read
        thermometer inserted into the center should read 150 degrees F (65
        degrees C).
